# TP-IV
In the following code, there is part of the work done during my TP-IV project. I built an one layer fully connected neural network and I trained it on the MINST dataset to recognise if the number in the image is even or odd.

The file even-odd does what is described above while time_gpu_cpu wants to compare the difference in time by using the CPU or the GPU
